# E-Commerce Back End

The following app is the working backend for an e-commerce platform that gives the user the ability to interact with their tags, products, and categories. Interactions include viewing existing data, updating existing data, adding new data, and deleting existing data.

The following screen captures are a limited scope of the full application. Please watch the attached video for a full visualization of the working app.
